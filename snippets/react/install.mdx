    <CardGroup cols={2}>
        <Card title="Marketing API Key" icon="filter">
            The marketing api key is meant for your landing pages, docs, blog, and other similar sites. The marketing dashboard will auto-populate with data regarding page views, browser types, etc on users that land on these pages.
        </Card>
        <Card title="Product API Key" icon="arrow-pointer">
            The product api key is meant for your app. Since you've sparated marketing from product we're able to easily pre-build a product usage dashboard for your users.
        </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    Both keys feature the same features in terms of tracking events and identifying users. The core difference is in utilizing the pre-build dashboards out of the box.
